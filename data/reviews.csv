The performance it delivers is just unmatched. On practical usage, it can easily beat the high-end Windows laptops. You are gonna love it from the moment you unbox it and would kinda wanna eat it once it falls in your hands.

The Apple silicon laptops really over-deliver than their on-paper specs. If it fits your budget...

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M2 ,5,Best in the market!,"The deep midnight color is striking and adds a touch of elegance. The viewing experience is truly remarkable, providing vivid and immersive visuals. It's suitable for standard video and photo editing tasks. However, for users engaging in intensive video editing, it is advisable to choose the 512GB storage option due to the slower SSD speed of the 256GB model. Overall, considering the features and performance at this price point, it's a compelling deal."

Acer Aspire 7 Intel Core i5 12th Gen 12450H ,4,Really Nice,"Best in this price range. Battery backup is decent (unlike other reviews. And it depends on usage and optimisation)
2-3 cons that I noticed ( rest everything is perfect for me):
1. Speakers are not loud but it's a not a big thing for me, I can use external speakers.
2. During gaming, heats a bit around the keyboard area as the air flows through the keyboard into the fans and gets out of the bottom.

Acer Aspire 7 Intel Core i5 12th Gen 12450H ,4,Nice product,"1. Well gaming laptops don't have long battery life that's for sure.

2. Although the screen is bright enough, but an anti glare display along with these brightness would have been better.

3. We have to plug in the charger to be able to play high end games like gta v, AC series, RDR 2, Battlefield Series, COD series etc. GTA V in 1080p setting gives around 60 fps on average, other games gives e.g, RDR2 on medium settings 40fps, Valorant high settings 80-100 fps.

There are several pros for the device. It has enough computing power to provide decent FPS gaming on more recent titles. The fans are fine and the device does run slightly hot.

Definitely needs to be tinkered with for maintaining battery backup, but can provide solid performance on demand. I have started Horizon Forbidden West play through recently and it works albeit with some tinkering on settings.

HP Chromebook Intel Celeron Dual Core N4500 ,4,Nice product,The biggest use case for a laptop is probably as a portable workstation they can be carried to office or to college. This laptop has to be powerful enough to get work done fast. It should be a device with a healthy battery back up and at the same time not too bulky. And it helps immensely if it’s easy on the wallet. HP’s new laptop called HP 14s is a product that tries to condense all the above-mentioned requirements . I am very happy.

ASUS Vivobook 15 Intel Core i3 11th Gen 1115G4 ,5,Excellent,"My honest review after using it for 4months . My model is 8/256 and it is really value for money model. It fulfills your basic work related and student related requirements. And sometimes and can also used for gaming (not for high end games). Design is really fabulous. Battery is an issue, drain too fast. Other than this I believe it is value for money(mine is 27k).

Note : Will update the review after 6months."

ASUS TUF Gaming F15 Intel Core i5 12th Gen 12500H ,5,Brilliant,"The performance is beyond best, the only things is there is a lot of fan sound and CPU heating which in my opinion is normal while gaming.

2 fans both at right side of laptop. When going ultra or lang hours gaming, it starts heating.
All games are good with low or midium graphics setting with 30 to 50 fps max.
Some old games like GTA 5 will get good FPS but when you start with grid 5, hellblade or AC origins and simillar, you have to drop the settings to medium or low.

Acer Nitro V AMD Ryzen 7 Octa Core 7735HS ,1,Not recommended at all,It's been only three days. Charger not working.
Acer Nitro V AMD Ryzen 7 Octa Core 7735HS ,2,Nice,Build quality of Acer Nitro from 4 or 5 years ago was much better than this. The keyboard seems relatively flimsy for a gaming laptop. The worst design flaw of this laptop is that the display opens up in such a way that that the hot air from the fan vents hit one side of the bottom of the display which starts heating up. This most definitely reduces the life of the display. It doesn't feel as if this laptop Nitro model is durable enough to last more than a couple of years.

Acer Nitro V AMD Ryzen 7 Octa Core 7735HS ,1,Not recommended at all,It's been only three days. Charger not working.
Acer Nitro V AMD Ryzen 7 Octa Core 7735HS ,2,Nice,Build quality of Acer Nitro from 4 or 5 years ago was much better than this. The keyboard seems relatively flimsy for a gaming laptop. The worst design flaw of this laptop is that the display opens up in such a way that that the hot air from the fan vents hit one side of the bottom of the display which starts heating up. This most definitely reduces the life of the display. It doesn't feel as if this laptop Nitro model is durable enough to last more than a couple of years.

In its first attempt, Realme has got off to a good start with excellent design and screen on the Realme Book Slim. The performance is good too and as an overall package - we can recommend the Realme Book Slim. The lack of a 16GB RAM variant in India and limited ports are a couple of letdowns, but if that’s not a deal-breaker for you, the Realme Book Slim won’t disappoint you.

Colorful P15 Intel Core i7 12th Gen 12650H ,5,Classy product,"Pros : Such a beast laptop. Easily handles heavy 3d editing sculpting coding designing animation almost everything. Fans are quite loud and can handle the thermals pretty well.speakers I'd say aren't so bad. Those are loud. But a bit torn sound. Would be a great choice for students who are not so much into portability. As you'll need to charge it thrice a day or even more. In my case I use it light mostly hence I've to charge to twice. Depends upon your usage.
Cons : battery I'd say is below ...

Colorful P15 Intel Core i7 12th Gen 12650H ,5,Terrific,"Review after using it for 1 week
Fast delivery by Flipkart and received the laptop within 1 day. Gaming Performance is very good so far in games like RDR 2, cyberpunk punk with 70- 90 fps in ultra settings and temperature around 85 degrees without using a cooling pad and playing for 3-4 hours.

I would recommend it based on price and gaming performance."
Colorful P15 Intel Core i7 12th Gen 12650H ,3,Good,"This laptop comes with good hardware, but it thermal throttles extremely. Especially the white and black colour comes with sub par cooling system and the fan has started making a weird cranking noise which is suspect is from a bad bearing in the fan. As you can see the cpu only has one heat pipe and GPU has two . Which is less that the blue model (blue model has 4 or 5 heat pipes) and they are with a copper colour. I upgraded the ram to 48 gb. The build in ram is a crucial 16gb stick clocked ...

Colorful P15 Intel Core i7 12th Gen 12650H ,4,Very Good,"Writing this review after 1 week usage:
Display: Crisp 10/10
Speakers: only thing i did not like about this laptop but with external audio device giving amazing output
Thermals: so far my unit is not having any thermals issues at all. Maximum temperature it reached on max performance mode playing AAA games is 85. Which is highly acceptable.
Overall performance is at par with other competitors in this segment."

Only draw back is the battery . But if ur using it for gaming every laptop needs to be plugged in for best performance . . The laptop does heat up coz of the 4060 and the 12650h .

I don't know how, but they are doing a very good job.

Now Cons:
1. No dedicated service stations.
2. A QR code is on keyboard side for the same.
Very disappointed with the service centre the way they planned.

The laptop has already started lagging andAcer's customer support is very bad

*My opinion is buy another brand laptop.

pros - It has no pros."

Would've liked more storage but it's always upgradable.


Review Update :
Turns out Acer Nitro with Rtx3070ti Is cheaper than this model , NVIDIA has tricked us by giving inferior hardware compared to last generation(Rtx30 series) and just adding software upgrades to make games run smoother(DLSS )

Rtx4060 is barely better than an Rtx 3060

Rtx 3070ti is better than Rtx4060


Overall it is still a great value for money but there i...

Lenovo LOQ AMD Ryzen 7 Octa Core 7435HS ,5,Terrific,"Everything is good but the chief complaints are :

Plastic Body : Acer makes metal laptops for quite cheap price
Bad Speakers : Too low volume, Asus Rog has best speakers I have heard so far in a laptop
Bad Battery : My old Acer which is almost 6 years old has better battery backup than this.
Rest all is good. The best part is the screen. Looks almost like amoled.

Let's start with gaming performance:

Performance:
This laptop handles games well, but a major problem is occasional stuttering. It's not due to power, as the RX6500m is quite powerful (similar to an RTX 2050, sufficient for 1080p gaming). I believe it's because of the PCIe Gen 3 port limitation, as the Ryzen 5 only supports Gen 3 PCIe, and unfortunately, it can't be solved.

HP Victus gaming AMD Ryzen 5 Hexa Core 5600H ,4,Wonderful,"This review will be detailed, covering everything about the Ryzen 5600H RX6500M variant.

Let's start with gaming performance:

Performance:
This laptop handles games well, but a major problem is occasional stuttering. It's not due to power, as the RX6500m is quite powerful (similar to an RTX 2050, sufficient for 1080p gaming). I believe it's because of the PCIe Gen 3 port limitation, as the Ryzen 5 only supports Gen 3 PCIe, and unfortunately, it can't be solved.

Lenovo LOQ AMD Ryzen 7 Octa Core 7435HS ,4,Delightful,"The laptop's performance has been been top notch for the price but the only diappointment I have is with the battery life, since the laptop has no vram for any slightly intensive tasks the gpu kicks in effecting the battery life. I got upto 2:30hrs while playing a game and browsing, which is not that great considering the other options available. Also I installed a 1TB SSD in the second slot since the 512gb wouldn't be enough at all.All in all its a good laptop for the price."

Lenovo LOQ AMD Ryzen 7 Octa Core 7435HS ,5,Excellent,"At this price point and performance, this laptop is awesome for gaming. I easily get 100+ fps on GTA 5 and 70+ fps on Assassin's Creed Valhalla. I'm a bit disappointed that the new Ryzen CPU doesn't have integrated graphics, so it uses the dGPU all the time. Because of this, the laptop only gets around 3.5 hours of battery life.

In terms of display, speaker, and RAM, there's nothing to complain about. The only thing you might need to do is upgrade the SSD to 1TB because only 400GB is usable ...

The thermals are good enough, when I was playing God of war on high setting the fans threw air like a jet.TGP is 105W which is great. The only catch is there's no iGPU (i.e rtx 4050 will always be used for display) which shortens battery life (3-4hrs). Overall the laptop is great. Highly recommended."

One more thing is that, the heating problem. Yes of course it has a heating problem because it's a 14 inch laptop and your laptop ventilation is on the back Better if you use a laptop stand to overcome it.
It is a light-weight laptop. That is also a significant work from HP. ...

It's screen quality is awesome at this price point because it has 100% sRGB and a LCD panel in which viewing angle are surprisingly good
Battery backup is around 4-5 hours at moderate usage.
Backlit keyboard is awesome 🥳
Speakers quality is decent, bass is missing 🙂
Slimmest laptop as claimed by Infinix.💯
Charging is pretty fast ( It tooks 1 hours to charge 75%)
Smooth experience and it's better for day to day normal usage

Highly recommended for those ...

One more thing is that, the heating problem. Yes of course it has a heating problem because it's a 14 inch laptop and your laptop ventilation is on the back Better if you use a laptop stand to overcome it.
It is a light-weight laptop. That is also a significant work from HP. ...

Product itself came with empty battery. I charged it as per HP recommendations. Still it Lasts up to 3 hours only. Drains very quickly after the first 2 hours. There is a significant drop in battery power after a shut down and a fresh start. Thus, disabled fast start up of Windows 11. Still this problem persists to some extent."

3-4 hrs on heavy tasks. I ran ANSYS, Matlab and solidworks on this machine all work fine and too good.
The display is very good so is the build quality.
Must have given 90hz refresh rate but it feel fine without it due to smooth and color rich display..

The biggest positive is battery and weight of the laptop. Simply feels nothing on my backpack and is even lighter...
